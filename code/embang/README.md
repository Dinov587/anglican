# embang

embang, or m!, is an implementation of [Anglican](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~fwood/anglican/),
inside Clojure. An Anglican program is translated into Clojure using macros, converted into
CPS, and executed with different inference algorithms. Some understanding of using CPS transformation
for probabilistic program can be obtained from the online book[The Design and Implementation
Of Probabilistic Programming Languages](http://dippl.org/). However, the implementation of m!
deviates in many ways from the approach outlined in the book.
