(namespace embang.trap)

;;; Trampoline-ready Anglican program 

;; The input to this series of transformation is an Anglican
;; program in clojure syntax (embang.xlat). The output is a
;; Clojure function that returns either the next step as a
;; continuation parameterized by the random choice, or the
;; result as a vector of predicted values and the sample weight.
;;
;; Steps are delimited by random choices.  Between the steps,
;; the inference decisions can be made.
;;
;; The state is threaded through computation and consists of
;;   - the running sample weight
;;   - the list of predicted values.
