the UCB of an arm for K arms and N pulls is bounded from below
by C\sqrt { \log N}. Which means that every arm for given N
is pulled with probability greater than 

\frac {C\sqrt {\log N}} {(K-1)(1+C)+C\sqrt{\log N}}

On the other hand, the weight of a variable changes by at most

\frac 1 N_i  - which diminishes in probability
