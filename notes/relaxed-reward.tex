Poisson:

\[\mathrm{pmf}(k) = \frac {\lambda^k} {k!} e^{-\lambda}\]

where $\lambda$ is the average number of other choices
appearing between occurences of the marked choice.

Average reward given to the marked choice is

\begin{align*}
	 \overline R & =  \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac 1 {k+1} \frac {\lambda^k} {k!} e^{-\lambda} \\
				 & = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac {\lambda^k} {(k+1)!} e^{-\lambda} \\
		         & = \frac 1 \lambda \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac {\lambda^k} {k!} e^{-\lambda} \\
	             & = \frac 1 \lambda \left(1 - e^{-\lambda}\right)
\end{align*}

Sanity check:

\begin{align*}
	\lim_{\lambda \to 0} \overline R & = 1 \\
	\lim_{\lambda \to \infty} \lambda {\overline R}  & = 1 
 \end{align*}

In other words, the relaxed reward computed by the algorithm increases
with selection rate of the marked choice. In the equilibrium distribution,
choices are selected according to their relaxed rewards.
