Acceptance ratio in RDB:

Pr-new = + spent-new observed-new restored-new
Pr-old = + spent-old observed-old restored-old
rcp-old = - $ log N-old
rcp-new = - $ log N-new
rnd-old = spent-old
rnd-new = spent-new
old-to-new = + rcp-old val-new rnd-new
new-ro-old = + rcp-new val-old rnd-old

ratio = - (+ pr-new  new-to-old ) (+ pr-old old-to-new)

= - (+ observed-new restored-new (log |old|) val-old )
  (+ observed-old restored-old (log |new|) val-new )

= - (+ log-weight-new (- restored-new val-new) (log |old|))
    (+ log-weight-old (- restored-old val-old) (log |new|))

;; in m! would be

= - (+ log-weight-new rescored-new (log |old|))
	(- log-weight-old rescored-old (new |new|))
